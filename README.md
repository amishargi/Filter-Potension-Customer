# Filter-Potension-Customer
# Background

A manager at a bank was bothered by more and more customers leaving the card service.

They would really appreciate it if someone could find out customer profiles so that they could know which customers are leaving so that they could proactively approach customers to provide better service and change customers in the opposite direction.

As a team of data engineers, I want to find the elements that contribute to client reduction.

# Business Objective
1. Determine the root causes of client attrition.
2. Give consumers who could be at danger of attrition preventative measures.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
## Data Overview

## Attrition Rate by Income Category

The most devoted clients were those earning between $80K and $120K, while those earning more over $120K saw a 17.33% greater attrition rate than the other groups.

## Attrition Rate by Marital Status

Married customers make up the majority of consumers, yet when compared to other customers, clients with unknown status experience the greatest turnover rates with 17.22%.


# Business Recomendation
The following conclusions are reached as a result of the exploratory data analysis:
1. The income and the number of dependents have an impact on the customer's attrition. This can make it harder for a client to pay their credit card payments.
2. Filtering credit approvals to minimize the possibility that customers are unable to pay and end up leaving the use of credit cards.
3. To maintain devoted clients who use credit cards, provide promotions as necessary.
